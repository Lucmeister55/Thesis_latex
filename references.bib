	sequencing analysis of {DNA} methylation",
	author    = "Shiraishi, Masahiko and Hayatsu, Hikoya",
	abstract  = "Bisulfite genomic sequencing is a widely used technique for
	analyzing cytosine-methylation of DNA. By treating DNA with
	bisulfite, cytosine residues are deaminated to uracil, while
	leaving 5-methylcytosine largely intact. Subsequent PCR and
	nucleotide sequence analysis permit unequivocal determination of
	the methylation status at cytosine residues. A major caveat
	associated with the currently practiced procedure is that it
	takes 16-20 hr for completion of the conversion of cytosine to
	uracil. Here we report that a complete deamination of cytosine
	to uracil can be achieved in shorter periods by using a highly
	concentrated bisulfite solution at an elevated temperature. Time
	course experiments demonstrated that treating DNA with 9 M
	bisulfite for 20 min at 90 degrees C or 40 min at 70 degrees C
	all cytosine residues in the DNA were converted to uracil. Under
	these conditions, the majority of 5-methylcytosines remained
	intact. When a high molecular weight DNA derived from a cell
	line (containing a number of genes whose methylation status was
	known) was treated with bisulfite under the above conditions and
	amplified and sequenced, the results obtained were consistent
	with those reported in the literature. Although some degradation
	of DNA occurred during this process, the amount of treated DNA
	required for the amplification was nearly equal to that required
	for the conventional bisulfite genomic sequencing procedure. The
	increased speed of DNA methylation analysis with this novel
	procedure is expected to advance various aspects of DNA
	sciences.",

	We report a genomic sequencing method that provides positive

	strand-specific sequences of individual molecules in genomic
	DNA. The method utilizes bisulfite-induced modification of
	genomic DNA, under conditions whereby cytosine is converted to

	under investigation is then amplified by PCR with two sets of
	strand-specific primers to yield a pair of fragments, one from
	each strand, in which all uracil and thymine residues have been
	amplified as thymine and only 5-methylcytosine residues have
	been amplified as cytosine. The PCR products can be sequenced
	directly to provide a strand-specific average sequence for the
	population of molecules or can be cloned and sequenced to
	provide methylation maps of single DNA molecules. We tested the
	method by defining the methylation status within single DNA
	strands of two closely spaced CpG dinucleotides in the promoter
	of the human kininogen gene. During the analysis, we encountered

abstract = {Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell-death modality driven by oxidative phospholipid damage. In contrast to apoptosis, which enables organisms to eliminate targeted cells purposefully at specific times, ferroptosis appears to be a vulnerability of cells that otherwise use high levels of polyunsaturated lipids to their advantage. Cells in this high polyunsaturated lipid state generally have safeguards that mitigate ferroptotic risk. Since its recognition, ferroptosis has been implicated in degenerative diseases in tissues including kidney and brain, and is a targetable vulnerability in multiple cancers—each likely characterized by the high polyunsaturated lipid state with insufficient or overwhelmed ferroptotic safeguards. In this Perspective, we present progress toward defining the essential roles and key mediators of lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in disease contexts. Moreover, we discuss gaps in our understanding of ferroptosis and list key challenges that have thus far limited the full potential of targeting ferroptosis for improving human health.},

abstract = {Traditional cancer therapy is mainly targeting on enhancing cell apoptosis, however, it is well established that many cancer cells are chemo-resistant and defective in apoptosis induction. Therefore, it may have important therapeutic implications to exploit some novel natural compounds based on non-apoptotic programmed cell death. Currently, accumulating evidence shows that the compounds from nature source can induce non-apoptotic programmed cell death in cancer cells, and therefore these natural compounds have gained a great promise for the future anticancer therapeutics. In this review, we will concentrate our efforts on the latest developments regarding major forms of non-apoptotic programmed cell death--autophagic cell death, necroptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, glutamoptosis and exosome-associated cell death. Our increased understanding of the role of natural compounds in regulating non-apoptotic programmed cell death will hopefully provide prospective strategies for cancer therapy.},

               death that is distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy.
               Extensive studies suggest that ferroptosis plays a pivotal role
               in tumor suppression, thus providing new opportunities for
               cancer therapy. The development of resistance to cancer therapy
               remains a major challenge. A number of preclinical and clinical
               studies have focused on overcoming drug resistance.
               Intriguingly, ferroptosis has been correlated with cancer
               therapy resistance, and inducing ferroptosis has been
               demonstrated to reverse drug resistance. Herein, we provide a
               detailed description of the mechanisms of ferroptosis and the
               therapeutic role of regulating ferroptosis in reversing the
               resistance of cancer to common therapies, such as chemotherapy,
               targeted therapy and immunotherapy. We discuss the prospect and
               challenge of regulating ferroptosis as a therapeutic strategy
               for reversing cancer therapy resistance and expect that our
               review could provide some references for further studies.",

abstract = {As an emerging cancer therapeutic target, non-apoptotic cell death such as ferroptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis, etc., has revealed significant potential in cancer treatment for bypassing apoptosis to enhance the undermined therapeutic efficacy triggered by apoptosis resistance. A variety of anticancer drugs, synthesized compounds and natural products have been proven recently to induce non-apoptotic cell death and exhibit excellent anti-tumor effects. Moreover, the convergence of nanotechnology with functional materials and biomedicine science has provided tremendous opportunities to construct non-apoptotic cell death-based nanomedicine for innovative cancer therapy. Nanocarriers are not only employed in targeted delivery of non-apoptotic inducers, but also used as therapeutic components to induce non-apoptotic cell death to achieve efficient tumor treatment. This review first introduces the main characteristics, the mechanism and various pharmacological modulators of different non-apoptotic cell death forms, including ferroptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, autophagy, paraptosis, lysosomal-dependent cell death, and oncosis. Second, we comprehensively review the latest progresses of nanomedicine that induces various forms of non-apoptotic cell death and focus on the nanomedicine targeting different pathways and components. Furthermore, the combination therapies of non-apoptotic cell death with photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, immunotherapy and other modalities are summarized. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives in this regard are also discussed.},
