	The mechanism of RPE cell death is not yet fully elucidated.
	Ferroptosis, a novel regulated cell death pathway, participates
	in cancer and several neurodegenerative diseases. Glutathione
	peroxidase 4 (GPx-4) and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1)
	have been proposed to be two main regulators of ferroptosis in
	these diseases; yet, their roles in RPE degeneration remain
	elusive. Here, we report that both FSP1-CoQ10-NADH and GSH-GPx-4
	pathways inhibit retinal ferroptosis in sodium iodate
	(SIO)-induced retinal degeneration pathologies in human primary
	RPE cells (HRPEpiC), ARPE-19 cell line, and mice. GSH-GPx-4
	signaling was compromised after a toxic injury caused by SIO,
	which was aggravated by silencing GPx-4, and ferroptosis
	inhibitors robustly protected RPE cells from the challenge.
	Interestingly, while inhibition of FSP1 caused RPE cell death,
	which was aggravated by SIO exposure, overexpression of FSP1
	effectively protected RPE cells from SIO-induced injury,
	accompanied by a significant down-regulation of CoQ10/NADH and
	lipid peroxidation. Most importantly, in vivo results showed
	that Ferrostatin-1 not only remarkably alleviated SIO-induced
	RPE cell loss, photoreceptor death, and retinal dysfunction but
	also significantly ameliorated the compromised GSH-GPx-4 and
	FSP1-CoQ10-NADH signaling in RPE cells isolated from SIO-induced

	abstract  = "Although vertebrate DNA is generally depleted in the

	vertebrate genes contain CpG islands, regions of DNA with a high
	G+C content and a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides relative
	to the bulk genome. In this study, a large number of sequences
	of vertebrate genes were screened for the presence of CpG
	islands. Each CpG island was then analysed in terms of length,
	nucleotide composition, frequency of CpG dinucleotides, and
	location relative to the transcription unit of the associated
	gene. CpG islands were associated with the 5' ends of all
	housekeeping genes and many tissue-specific genes, and with the
	3' ends of some tissue-specific genes. A few genes contained
	both 5' and 3' CpG islands, separated by several thousand
	base-pairs of CpG-depleted DNA. The 5' CpG islands extended
	through 5'-flanking DNA, exons and introns, whereas most of the
	3' CpG islands appeared to be associated with exons. CpG islands
	were generally found in the same position relative to the
	transcription unit of equivalent genes in different species,
	with some notable exceptions. The locations of G/C boxes,
	composed of the sequence GGGCGG or its reverse complement
	CCGCCC, were investigated relative to the location of CpG
	islands. G/C boxes were found to be rare in CpG-depleted DNA and
	plentiful in CpG islands, where they occurred in 3' CpG islands,
	as well as in 5' CpG islands associated with tissue-specific and
	housekeeping genes. G/C boxes were located both upstream and
	downstream from the transcription start site of genes with 5'
	CpG islands. Thus, G/C boxes appeared to be a feature of CpG
	islands in general, rather than a feature of the promoter region
	of housekeeping genes. Two theories for the maintenance of a
	high frequency of CpG dinucleotides in CpG islands were tested:
	that CpG islands in methylated genomes are maintained, despite a
	tendency for 5mCpG to mutate by deamination to TpG+CpA, by the
	structural stability of a high G+C content alone, and that CpG
	islands associated with exons result from some selective
	importance of the arginine codon CGX. Neither of these theories
	could account for the distribution of CpG dinucleotides in the

abstract = {Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell-death modality driven by oxidative phospholipid damage. In contrast to apoptosis, which enables organisms to eliminate targeted cells purposefully at specific times, ferroptosis appears to be a vulnerability of cells that otherwise use high levels of polyunsaturated lipids to their advantage. Cells in this high polyunsaturated lipid state generally have safeguards that mitigate ferroptotic risk. Since its recognition, ferroptosis has been implicated in degenerative diseases in tissues including kidney and brain, and is a targetable vulnerability in multiple cancers‚Äîeach likely characterized by the high polyunsaturated lipid state with insufficient or overwhelmed ferroptotic safeguards. In this Perspective, we present progress toward defining the essential roles and key mediators of lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in disease contexts. Moreover, we discuss gaps in our understanding of ferroptosis and list key challenges that have thus far limited the full potential of targeting ferroptosis for improving human health.},

Therefore, it may have important therapeutic implications to exploit some novel natural compounds based on non-apoptotic programmed cell death. Currently, accumulating evidence shows that the compounds from nature source can induce non-apoptotic programmed cell death in cancer cells, and therefore these natural compounds have gained a great promise for the future anticancer therapeutics. In this review, we will concentrate our efforts on the latest developments regarding major forms of non-apoptotic programmed cell death--autophagic cell death, necroptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, glutamoptosis and exosome-associated cell death. Our increased understanding of the role of natural compounds in regulating non-apoptotic programmed cell death will hopefully provide prospective strategies for cancer therapy.},

               death that is distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy.
               Extensive studies suggest that ferroptosis plays a pivotal role
               in tumor suppression, thus providing new opportunities for
               cancer therapy. The development of resistance to cancer therapy
               remains a major challenge. A number of preclinical and clinical
               studies have focused on overcoming drug resistance.
               Intriguingly, ferroptosis has been correlated with cancer
               therapy resistance, and inducing ferroptosis has been
               demonstrated to reverse drug resistance. Herein, we provide a
               detailed description of the mechanisms of ferroptosis and the
               therapeutic role of regulating ferroptosis in reversing the
               resistance of cancer to common therapies, such as chemotherapy,
               targeted therapy and immunotherapy. We discuss the prospect and
               challenge of regulating ferroptosis as a therapeutic strategy
               for reversing cancer therapy resistance and expect that our
               review could provide some references for further studies.",

abstract = {As an emerging cancer therapeutic target, non-apoptotic cell death such as ferroptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis, etc., has revealed significant potential in cancer treatment for bypassing apoptosis to enhance the undermined therapeutic efficacy triggered by apoptosis resistance. A variety of anticancer drugs, synthesized compounds and natural products have been proven recently to induce non-apoptotic cell death and exhibit excellent anti-tumor effects. Moreover, the convergence of nanotechnology with functional materials and biomedicine science has provided tremendous opportunities to construct non-apoptotic cell death-based nanomedicine for innovative cancer therapy. Nanocarriers are not only employed in targeted delivery of non-apoptotic inducers, but also used as therapeutic components to induce non-apoptotic cell death to achieve efficient tumor treatment. This review first introduces the main characteristics, the mechanism and various pharmacological modulators of different non-apoptotic cell death forms, including ferroptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, autophagy, paraptosis, lysosomal-dependent cell death, and oncosis. Second, we comprehensively review the latest progresses of nanomedicine that induces various forms of non-apoptotic cell death and focus on the nanomedicine targeting different pathways and components. Furthermore, the combination therapies of non-apoptotic cell death with photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, immunotherapy and other modalities are summarized. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives in this regard are also discussed.},
